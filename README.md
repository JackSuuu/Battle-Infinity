## About the Project

**Punk Battle Refine** is an iteration of the original Punk Battle game aimed at delivering a more engaging and visually captivating experience. Built entirely in JavaScript using Kaboom.js, the game leverages modern web technologies to bring fast-paced, arcade-style action directly to your browser.

The game integrate a AI reinforcement learning neural network to predict the action for second player.

### ðŸ§¬ Neural Network (Reinforcement Learning)

**Key Components:**

- **Network:** Configured for 9 inputs (game state) and 4 outputs (actions).
- **trainingData:** Stores input-output pairs globally within `neural.js`.
- **loadAI:** Loads saved model at game start.
- **saveAI:** Saves model after training.
- **trainAI:** Trains on collected data, limiting to 1000 samples.
- **collectData:** Adds player1 state and actions to trainingData.
- **predictAction:** Outputs AI actions for player2 based on game state.
- **Export:** Uses window.AI to make functions accessible to main.js(avoids ES module complexity in browsers).

#### How AI works?

- **First match:** AI may be inactive (untrained).
- **After match:** Training runs (check console).
- **Next match:** AI mimics player1 (e.g., moves toward you).

#### Observation

> At the outset of the game, the AI exhibits relatively unsophisticated behavior, often failing to initiate any attacks. However, as the game progresses, it incrementally learns and adapts to the player's actions, resulting in increasingly rapid and precise responses. Notably, by the third and fourth games, the AI demonstrates a marked improvement in strategic behavior, reflecting a significant enhancement in its decision-making capabilities.
